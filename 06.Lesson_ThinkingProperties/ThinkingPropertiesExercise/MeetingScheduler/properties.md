- (Variable Transaction) State of meetings: UNINITIALIZED -> PENDING -> CANCELLED
                                                          -> STARTED -> ENDED
- (High level) Only owner can cancel a meeting
- (High level) Anyone can start a pending meeting
- (High level) Anyone can end a started meeting if the **ending time is met**
- (Variable transaction) Meeting can only start after calling `startMeeting`
- (Variable transaction) Meeting can only be cancelled after calling `cancelMeeting` by the owner
- (Variable transaction) Meeting can only be ended after calling `endMeeting`
- (Variable transaction) `numOfParticipants` can never be decreased
- (High level) `numOfParticipants` is only increased when calling `joinMeeting`
- (Unit test) `numOfParticipants` is increased by `1` when calling `joinMeeting`
- `organizer` can never change
- (Valid State) I guess depending on the `status` different conditions for `startTime` or `endTime` must be met (difficult to tell looking at the interface)
- `startTime <= endtime` for an `auctionId`
